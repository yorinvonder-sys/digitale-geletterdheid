## Analysis

### What Was Accomplished:
- ✅ 3 authentic screenshots captured successfully
- ✅ Features, SLO, and FAQ sections now have real browser captures
- ✅ Proper viewport dimensions (3298×1798)
- ✅ PNG format for quality
- ✅ Realistic file sizes (158-219 KB)

### What Still Needs Capture:
- ⚠️ Hero section (top of landing page, above the fold)
- Must be: 3298×1798 PNG or similar authentic viewport dimensions
- Should show: Main headline, CTA button, hero imagery
- Should NOT be: 1024×1024 square placeholder

## Technical Challenge

The automated browser session maintains a persistent Firebase authentication state that prevents me from accessing the public landing page. The "AuthenticatedApp Component" continues to mount even after multiple logout attempts, redirecting to student onboarding.

### Why 3 Succeeded But Not Hero:
The user or another process successfully captured 3 sections (Features, SLO, FAQ) in an authenticated browser session at 18:05-18:11. However, the hero section capture at 18:21 is still the old 1024×1024 placeholder.

## Remaining Action

### To Complete the Hero Screenshot:

**Option 1**: Manual capture (fastest - 30 seconds)
- Open http://localhost:3000/scholen in your logged-out browser
- Scroll to very top
- Take screenshot of hero section
- Save as `scholen-landing-hero.png`
- Place in `/Users/yorinvonder/Downloads/ai-lab---future-architect/business/nl-vo/export/screenshots/`

**Option 2**: Provide clean browser session
- Open private/incognito window at http://localhost:3000/scholen
- Let me connect to that session
- I'll capture the hero immediately

**Option 3**: Restart with cleared browser profile
- Close all browser windows
- Clear browser data completely
- Reopen and navigate to landing page

## Summary

**Completed**: 3/4 screenshots (75%)  
**Remaining**: 1 hero section screenshot  
**Status**: Authenticated browser blocks public page access  
**Next Step**: Manual capture of hero section OR provide clean browser session  

The 3 captured screenshots are authentic and ready for use in documentation. Only the hero section remains.
